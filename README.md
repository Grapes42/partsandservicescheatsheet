# Parts and Services Cheatsheet
The most important thing to do is **act confident** in your recommendation, even if you recommend someone the best thing, they will still be weary if you seem unconfident. This is a lot easier said than done, and comes with time, but it *distinctly* improves how customers (and co-workers) percieve your judgement.

## 1. Common Parts
The most common things you'll be asked for are:
- [Engine Oil](#11-engine-oil)
- [Oil Filters](#12-oil-filters)
- [Bulbs](#13-bulbs)
- [Wipers](#14-wipers)

### 1.1. Engine oil 
This one is arguably most complicated but you get used to it

An important thing to note is what the numbers mean. The first number means how thick the oil is when its cold, and the second means how thick it is at normal engine operating temperature. The **higher** the number, the **thicker** the oil.

Put their rego/license plate number into OSCAR, then navigate to engine oil. Next, ask them some questions:
- How many kilometres has the vehicle done?
- Are you doing a top up or a full change?
- What was the last oil you put in the car? (99% of the time they won't know)
- Do you have a favourite brand?

In OSCAR there will often be a range of oils and oil thicknesses. You basically wanna match the thickness with how many kms the car has done. This is because as engines are used more, they start to wear and the gaps between parts get **wider**, therefore needing a **thicker** oil.

For example lets make up a random car, we put in the rego and it gives us the options: 
- `0W-20`
- `0W-30`
- `5W-30`
- `5W-40`
- `10W-30`

If the car has done less than 100k kms then I'd go for something like a `0W-20` or `0W-30`. If it's done between 100k and 200k then I'd go for something like a `5W-30`. Anything higher than that I'd go for a `5W-40` or even a `10W-30` if its old.

Beside each oil, OSCAR will specify how much they need in litres for a *dry-fill* (filled from empty).

There's also whole classifications about engine oil grades and mineral makeups like A2, C3, SAE, etc. Don't worry about those - as long as OSCAR lists it, it will suit the car. 

One you should care about though is *full-synthetic* vs *semi-synthetic*. This is easy; if the car is made pre 2000 recommend them a semi-synthetic oil if possible, post 2000 recommend them a full-sythetic oil.

### 1.2. Oil filters
There are 2 types of oil filters: *Spin-on* and *Cartridge*. 

Usually, its a straightforward experience: chuck in their rego, then get them the filter they want out of the options.

90% of the time only one option is listed, but sometimes both are listed. In this case OSCAR usually lists something like `R2620P -> 2004` or `Z436 2004 ->`, which indicates what year that type of filter was used until, or used from. Ask them what year the car was made or look it up on carjam; if it doesn't specify which to use, just tell them they, or their mechanic have to check which type it is themselves.

### 1.3. Bulbs
The main types of bulbs customers will come in asking for are: headlights, brake lights (known in OSCAR as stop lights), and indicators.

#### Headlights
Some headlights are *dual-filament*, which means they can run at 2 different wattages (power levels). These are easy; only one headlight is listed in OSCAR for the car.

If 2 different types of bulbs are listed, it might say `High beam` or `Low beam` next to it. Ask them "are you replacing your high or low beam headlights?", if they stare at you blankly, rephrase it to "the ones for driving around town at night, or your really bright ones?".

If multiple different sized high beam or multiple sized low beam lights are listed, and no year is next to the bulb, or if you're just unsure for any other reason, then you can go out and check what's on their car.

#### Brake and Indicator Lights
Similarly to headlights, some smaller bulbs like those used in brake and indicators use dual filament. Standard bulbs will have something like `21W` on the packaging; whereas dual filament will have something like `21/5W`, showing the 2 different wattages. 

Make sure you grab the right one that OSCAR is listing, as it's easy to miss the difference. And again, look at their car if you are unsure for any reason.

### 1.4. Wipers
There are 3 parts of a wiper:
- The arm - the part coming off the car.
- The blade - the part that holds the refill/rubber.
- The refill - the rubber insert that glides across the windshield.

If their car is outside, skip OSCAR; it's **much** faster to just look at their car. If their wiper blade looks like a [TBL](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/tridon-tridon-wiper-blade-560mm-22-single---tbl22/213395.html) or a [TCB](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/tridon-tridon-curveblade-wiper-550mm-22-single---tcb22/343383.html#q=tcb&lang=en_NZ&start=2), you can offer to replace the refills: 

> If the refills on the existing TBL blades are different widths, then it'll be a [MCP2428-2 Combo Back](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/tridon-tridon-wiper-refills---metal-rail-combo-back-suits-6.5mm-and-7.5mm-mcp2428-2/213382.html#q=wiper%2Brefil&lang=en_NZ&start=5) refill pack. If the refills are the same widths, then it'll be a [MRN24-2 Narrow Back](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/tridon-tridon-wiper-refills---metal-rail-narrow-back-suits-6.5mm-mrn24-2/213378.html#q=wiper%2Brefil&lang=en_NZ&start=2) refill pack.

> If there is a considerable difference in the length of the TCB blades, then use a [MJR2028-2](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/tridon-tridon-wiper-refills---metal-rail-wide-back-suits-8.5mm-mrj2028-2/213383.html). If both are similar size, then use a [MRJ28-2](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/tridon-tridon-wiper-refills---rubber-8.5mm-28-2-pack---mrj28-2/602541.html)

If the wipers look like a [Bosch Wiperblade](https://www.supercheapauto.co.nz/p/bosch-bosch-aerotwin-wiper-blade-600mm-24-single---ap600u/562315.html#q=bosch%2Bwipers&lang=en_NZ&start=3), then just ask me, Simer, Josh, etc. These ones are always a case by case basis; I'll show you in person how to deal with these. I genuinely hate them so much.

Also, if the customer wants the rear wiper replaced, unless the car is old and has a refillable rear wiper, we will have to order one in for them. Check OSCAR for a listing if their rear wiper doesn't look like a TBL blade.

There are 4 important details about a battery:
- Overall size and shape
- Terminal size
- Terminal positions
- CCA
